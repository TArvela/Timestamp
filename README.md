# Timestamp
This project is part of the "Back End Development Certification" given by the FreeCodeCamp website.

The goal of this project is to build a fullstack javascript app able to return timestamps in several formats. 
I also included a small initial webpage. 
Objectives from the project have been completed, however instead of returning null for invalid data it parses the parameter (it's not a bug, it's a feature)
If parse is impossible, "Invalid DateNaN" is returned.
